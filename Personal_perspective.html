                    How I think about the role of education
                    </h2>
                    Having the opportunity to study at a high-quality high school, 
                    I realized how strongly education can shape an individual’s life. 
                    My experience at Hanoi-Amsterdam High School for the Gifted has 
                    allowed me to broaden my horizons and challenge myself academically. 
                    The competitive and motivating environment encourages me to work consistently harder,
                    as I do not want to fall behind. Notably, the experience of co-authoring academic books 
                    is one of the most meaningful opportunities I have gained from studying in such a supportive learning 
                    environment. Therefore, I deeply value every opportunity to learn and
                    remain eager to continuously improve my academic performance.

                        Why I choose Electrical Engineering
                    </h2>
                    Electrical Engineering is the field that best aligns with 
                    my two favorite subjects: mathematics and physics. Beyond this, 
                    I am strongly motivated to explore how the electrical devices surrounding
                    my daily life are designed and developed. In the long term, I aspire to 
                    create practical inventions that can be applied in real-world contexts. 
                    From a broader perspective, I dream of a future in which my products 
                    become commercially viable under my own management.
