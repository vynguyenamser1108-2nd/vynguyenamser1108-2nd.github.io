                    My full name is Nguyen Le Phuong Vy. I am 
                    currently a student at Hanoi–Amsterdam High School 
                    for the Gifted, majoring in the mathematics specialized 
                    class.

                <p>
                    I was born into a family living in the capital 
                    of Vietnam. My family consists of five members,
                    and they have always been my greatest source of 
                    emotional support, helping me overcome challenges 
                    throughout my life.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Growing up in Northern Vietnam, I have sometimes 
                    encountered gender stereotypes that underestimate 
                    girls’ potential. Choosing to apply for Electrical
                    Engineering is not only a way for me to pursue my passion, 
                    but also an effort to challenge outdated perceptions that 
                    prevent many capable individuals from reaching their full 
                    potential.
