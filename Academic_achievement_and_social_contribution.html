            Achieving my SAT and IELTS scores marked the first step 
            in my application journey. Although I initially struggled, especially 
            with language learning after years of focusing on science, I came to 
            recognize the importance of foreign language proficiency in a globalized 
            world. This understanding motivated me to persist and ultimately reach my 
            goals. While the scores may not be exceptional, they reflect both my 
            abilities and a meaningful learning journey.

            In early 2025, I began studying A Level Mathematics (9709) for the May–June session, completing AS papers in Pure
            Mathematics 1 (P1) and Statistics 1 (S1), achieving 82% (grade A). 
            Although this result did not fully meet my expectations, the
            preparation process broadened my approach to mathematical 
            problem-solving by integrating methods from both the A Level 
            curriculum and my national education system. During the summer 
            of 2025, I continued preparing for the A2 papers (P3 and M1) as 
            well as Further Mathematics (9231). I am currently awaiting the 
            results and will update this section accordingly.

           I joined a team of six to participate in this competition in the 
           summer of 2025, initially as the only member with no prior coding 
           experience. I began learning programming independently through Codelearn.io,
            starting with Python and later C, before working with ESP32 
           microcontrollers and sensors such as DHT22 and PZEM004T.Through
            trial and error, and with guidance from my tutor, I learned to 
            debug logical issues and improve my code, which I later documented 
            on my personal GitHub. I was also introduced to mobile application 
            development and AI training. Although I did not build an 
            independent application, I gained a solid understanding of
             backend logic through MIT App Inventor, a block-based programming 
             platform.

            I conducted this project after spending some time with 
            the AI-JAM team, so I had accumulated more experience before 
            starting this activity. However, this time I was responsible for
            every aspect of the project, including software, firmware, and
            hardware. I learned how to use Altium Designer to create schematic files 
            and convert them into PCB designs. The project involved ESP32 and PZEM004T 
            components, combined with Hilink modules, relays, and a TFT screen. I made 
            several mistakes during the development process, but through those 
            experiences, I learned how to troubleshoot and improve my design.
            Later, I trained an AI model using my own documents and used it as a 
            learning companion to help explain my code and refine my understanding.

            Writing these books required me to study web development more deeply,

            own website.

            This experience not only allowed me to apply my knowledge in a practical setting,

            opportunities available to me.

            During my internship, I had the opportunity to 
            participate in the development of the solar-powered water heater 
            project, Model “Sonha 68.” I learned how to manage operational 
            efficiency by counting the number of outputs and comparing them to 
            the predicted results based on the input amounts. Efficiency checks 
            must be implemented at every stage to minimize waste and production 
            errors. If any issues arise that result in substandard quality at a 
            particular stage, I am required to report them to the manager for 
            resolution.
